/*
* Here is how input works for this game:
* 
* Once per frame platform_process_events() is called. This function
* polls Windows for events. If the event was a Keydown or 
* Syskeydown event we set the local keyboard state for the key to 
* true. Once the PeekMessage-Loop is done, we call the 
* input_add_events() function to add events to event_queue for all 
* keys that got set to true in keyboard_state in that PeekMessage-
* Loop. 
* 
* Later in the game_update() function we empty out the queue that
* holds all events that got added for this frame by calling 
* event_queue_next(). This way we keep track of the state of all
* keys that are down for one frame and handle it later in the 
* game_update() function.
